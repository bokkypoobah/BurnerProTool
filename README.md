# Burner.pro NFC Card Tool (WIP)

This repo initially started as a review of [burner.pro](https://burner.pro/), but some tools need to be built to provide alternative access to this card, if the original developer's website were to become unavailable.

See the [Burner.pro Review](./Review.md) (WIP).

We are not affiliated with burner.pro . This tool is under development, so test it with small amounts first.
